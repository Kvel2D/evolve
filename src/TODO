TODO

change from IntVector2 to Ve2i
remove IntVector2 and other gunk

stop moving code around

improve messages
    flying across the screen is impossible to read
    needs to be somewhere in a corner, unobstructed, but flashing or something

mutations into new types
    rare enough but not too much
    + announcement

toxic mineral
    damages units
    skill called resilience reduces damage
    required for new queens

IDEAS

need to balance skills against each other
    so that harvesting takes as much as moving
    changes later in the game of course as you expand further and further

change skill number for display
    0-100

track rates of change of different things
    metal/min
    food/min
    life expectancy?
        based on avg damage taken over previous period of time

wacky upgrades that cost a lot
    double amount of units produced by all queens
    increase amount of resource extracted from all dig nodes

think about equilibriums
    should be a point where colony produces X food, Y metal, Z units die every minute and W units are made with metals all of which sums up to stability
    and then mutations and new units push the equilibrium slightly

more interesting node connections
    maybe also sometimes connect to 2 nodes nearby? (so that's it's not all radial)

there should be a balanace between hunger and food production
    need to make it so that you can support a colony with just a small ratio (10-25%) harvesting

animals or natives which have small bases of their own

make it so that it's best to specialize
    make it progressively harder to generalize in multiple skills and impossible to make the "perfect" unit

how does fighting work?
    dedicated soldiers?
    but want fighting skill to matter so that for example if your mine is attached you want your miners to at least be able to do something

comfort temperature?
    if too far from some number, units start taking damage

events happen at each node
    for example, a mine is invaded
    maybe events spread?
    for example, if a mine is invaded and everyone is wiped out, enemies move to adjacent nodes

when cloning you can search different ordered mob lists
    top by X skill
    top by total skills
    etc
